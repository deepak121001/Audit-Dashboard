## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

### 1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd audit-tool
```

### 2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### 3. **Configure environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/audit-tool
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
SMTP_FROM=your_email@gmail.com
```

### 4. **Run both frontend and backend together**

#### **Option 1: Using npm scripts and concurrently**
- Install `concurrently` in the root directory:
  ```bash
  npm install -D concurrently
  ```
- Add this to your root `package.json`:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"",
    "server": "cd backend && npm run dev",
    "client": "cd frontend && npm run dev"
  }
  ```
- In `backend/package.json`, add:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon app.js"
  }
  ```
- Now run:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  This will start both backend and frontend in development mode.

#### **Option 2: Run separately**
- In one terminal:
  ```bash
  cd backend && npm run dev
  ```
- In another terminal:
  ```bash
  cd frontend && npm run dev
  ```
